In the task, it was required to simulate a view of a black hole with a disk from an arbitrary angle.
It was also necessary to take into account physical laws, including the curvature of light rays (in the images
a flat disk flows around the black hole on all sides).

Settings file format:
input 11 numbers:
1. 2 first types int - image resolution
2. 3 float types - camera position within black hole radii (event horizon)
3. 3 float types - camera direction (main direction, vector length doesn't matter)
4. 3 float types - direction of the vector up (where the picture looks up, the main direction)
About mass and radius: the mass of the hole is fixed, the radius is calculated using the Schwarzschild formula.


Program running time: a couple of seconds (config1.txt); a couple of seconds (config2.txt); a couple of seconds (config3.txt);
Bonuses: 1. alpha displacement
